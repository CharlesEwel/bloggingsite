    <h1>Welcome to the Blog of blogs</h1>
    <h2>Disc Golf</h2>
    <h4>Discs</h4>
    <p>I like to throw Valkyries, Rivers, Comets and Wizards. Currently I am
      trying to 'disc down' and use fairway drivers and midranges.
    <h4>Courses</h4>
    <p>Pier Park in St Johns is the best course in the city. Milo McIver is the
    best one in Oregon</p>
    <h4>Technique</h4>
    <p>Currently I am watching the 'Driving with Dan Beto' video and practicing
    my turbo putts</p>
    <h2>St Louis Cardinals</h2>
    <p>The Cardinals are struggling this year but they'll probably pull it out
      in the end anyways</p>
    <h2>Computer Games</h2>
    <p> I am currently playing Diplomacy and The Talos Principle</p>
